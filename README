Summary:
  This is a demo project using Crypto++ for iOS.
  See Crypto++ project page http://www.cryptopp.com/ for more info.

  Building with XCode 5.x is supported and toolchain is switched from GCC to Clang/LLVM.
  Note that you must not link stdlibc++ but libc++ for now, which is currently default.

Build the static universal library:
  1. open the Terminal and enter external/scripts directory.
  2. then, type ./build-cryptopp.sh
  3. if succeeded, external/include/cryptopp/*.h and external/lib/libcryptopp.a is there.
      check libcryptopp.a using file commad like this
	  > file external/lib/libcryptopp.a
	  external/lib/libcryptopp.a: Mach-O universal binary with 3 architectures
      external/lib/libcryptopp.a (for architecture i386):	current ar archive random library
      external/lib/libcryptopp.a (for architecture armv6):	current ar archive random library
      external/lib/libcryptopp.a (for architecture armv7):	current ar archive random library
      external/lib/libcryptopp.a (for architecture armv7s):	current ar archive random library
      now, you get an universal binary of Crypto++

Build demo app:
  1. Double click Cryptopp-for-iOS.xcodeproj
  2. Just run with XCode. That't too easy.

  Currently, only hash algorithm MD5/SHA examples are available.

License:
  Crypto++ is based on public domain license, 
  So I decided to apply this demo app the public domain license.

Have fun with Crypto++ on the iOS devices!
